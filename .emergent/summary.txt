The AI engineer's trajectory showcases a journey from initial bug fixes and minor enhancements to extensive feature development and persistent debugging. The primary challenge revolved around ensuring data synchronization and correct display across the frontend (admin and public views) and backend, often complicated by authentication issues and environment discrepancies (localhost vs. preview). The engineer systematically addressed 17 initial requirements, then a further 11 complex requests focusing on UI/UX (modal forms, CSS), comprehensive admin functionality (ticket, deposit, member management), and real-time messaging. Key technical actions included extensive modifications to , , and the introduction of reusable components like , , and dedicated detail components. Repeated troubleshooting highlighted the importance of verifying frontend data display against backend responses and environment-specific issues like CORS and cached data. The process concluded with the engineer starting implementation of a full messaging system and refining modal aesthetics and functionality.
