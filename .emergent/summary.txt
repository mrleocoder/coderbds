The previous AI engineer's trajectory shows a systematic, albeit iterative, approach to developing a full-stack real estate application. Initial work focused on fixing bugs and expanding functionality, culminating in comprehensive feature additions like modal forms, a real-time messaging system, and extensive admin panel management. Key challenges included ensuring data synchronization between frontend and backend, resolving authentication issues (e.g., admin login, member balance), addressing environment-specific discrepancies (localhost vs. preview URLs), and persistent UI/UX refinements based on user feedback. The engineer made significant modifications to core files like , , , and introduced new components (, , , ), alongside crucial documentation and utility scripts. The work often involved fixing regressions and re-addressing user complaints about features previously marked as 100% working, highlighting the complexity of full-stack data flow and UI rendering. The trajectory concludes with the AI engineer debugging why the admin dashboard fails to load data on the preview environment, despite backend APIs appearing functional.

<product_requirements>
The application is a responsive real estate website with core property and news management via an admin panel. Initially, it required pagination and specific Kho Sim and Dự án Đất sections. It evolved into a full real estate ecosystem, demanding client-side and admin data synchronization, admin dashboard charts, a customer ticket system, member registration/login, member post creation, a wallet with deposit functionality, and admin approvals for member content/deposits.

Key requirements introduced over time include:
- Navigation restructuring, dedicated contact page, enhanced filtering, SEO-friendly URLs.
- Member deposit system (QR, bank details, bill upload) with admin approval.
- Admin forms converting to modal popups, image upload with carousel.
- Comprehensive admin website settings (Title, Description, Email, Logo, Favicon, Bank Info).
- Admin member post approval, broken link fixes, mobile responsive admin dashboard, footer improvements, professional toast notifications, enhanced FAQ.
- Refining modal CSS, converting support ticket, deposit, member, and member post management to modal popups with detail views and messaging.
- Implementing a direct chat system between admin and members for tickets/deposits.
- Requiring user login/registration for the contact form.
- Adding three configurable contact button links in Website Settings.
- Ensuring real-time sync for admin CRUD operations on the customer site.
- Correcting display logic for FAQ sections and ensuring smooth scroll-to-top on page navigation.
- Fully functional image uploads for all content types (properties, news, lands) in admin.
- Fixing member post creation to work correctly, including balance checks.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing several critical issues to ensure the application's stability and full functionality. The primary focus was on resolving the recurring problem where the admin dashboard, when accessed via the preview URL, failed to load data. The backend APIs were confirmed to be accessible and functioning correctly on the preview URL, leading to the diagnosis that the issue lies within the frontend (potential JavaScript errors, CORS problems, authentication token issues, or improper handling of loading states in ). The last action was to plan adding better error handling and debug information to the admin dashboard to diagnose this data loading failure.

Concurrently, the engineer had just addressed a regression where the member's post creation was failing again (422 Validation Error). This was traced back to required fields like  and  not being correctly sent or formatted from the  form. The engineer confirmed the backend API worked via direct  but claimed the issue was a frontend modal overlay blocking click, despite the user explicitly stating the post was not saved. This indicates a potential remaining frontend issue with the member post form's actual submission or feedback loop.

Prior to these, extensive work was done to make the admin panel's CRUD operations 100% real (Chat 389), fixing image uploads, integrating real-time charts (, ), and ensuring Website Settings sync dynamically across the entire public-facing site (Chat 457). UI/UX refinements included responsive design for stats, consistent footers, and auto-closing navigation menus, though some specific button arrangements required reversions based on direct user feedback.
